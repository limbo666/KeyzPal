KeyzPal is a Windows tray utility to indicate the **CAPS**, **NUM** and **SCROLL** key status. 



The program currently offers:

- *Lightweight interface - Runs on system tray.*

- *Selectable Lock Keys to indicate.*

- *Option to auto start on windows start.*

- *Easy to use interface.*

- *Keys normalization function.*

- *Selectable icon sets.*  

  

Normalization function: 

This function can set the lock keys state to "normal" after a selectable period of time. From version 1.0.3.8 the program can detect key presses on the keyboard and reset the remaining time each time a key is pressed. This way the program will normalize the keys only if the system is inactive for the predefined time. 

Currently, normal state is consider as follows: 

**CAPS lock:** OFF

**NUM lock:** ON

**SCROLL lock:** OFF
